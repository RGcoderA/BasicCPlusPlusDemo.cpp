Boolean Values: In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False. 
You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
Lists are created using square brackets.
Numeric Types: int, float, complex.
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range.
Mapping Type: dict.
Set Types:set, frozenset.
Boolean Type:bool.
Binary Types:bytes, bytearray, memoryview.
None Type:NoneType,
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
